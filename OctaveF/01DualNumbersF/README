Dual number implementation until the fourth order.

Do not use subsref or A(:,...) inside the '@dualx' folders (x=1,...,4).
For this case use the takepart function. Also, use the setpart function
instead of subsasgn if necessary.

Do not use ketA = A(:) inside the '@dualx' folders to build a ket vector
from the elements of A, use ketA = ket(A) instead.

Do not use numel for dualx (x=1,2,3,4) arrays, this function is not
overloaded. Use product(size(A)) instead.

Overloaded functions.

Although care has been taken on writing the Matlab code, 
there is not guaranteed to be free of error. The use of the dual 
classes it is entirely at the user's risk and the author disclaims all 
liability.
